### Intro
We built a live captioning tool using Azure Cognitive Services, through the
Speech To Text AI reconigition. Our aim is to provide accessibility to
students with hearing problems. The application allows teachers to create
sessions and students to join them. Once a session has started, all the
students can see in their screen the live captions. The tool can be used
in a wide variety of contexts, but education is the priority.
